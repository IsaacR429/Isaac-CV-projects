This project is a self-contained demo of how to compute artificial baseline metrics for MuleSoft memory usage monitoring. It simulates the logic for real-time platform monitoring using static data and pre-generated graphs.

## Project Contents

-  Sample Excel data file (`Mulesoft_metrics.xlsx`)
-  Graphs showing memory usage and calculated baselines
-  (Optional) Scripts or notebooks to generate the plots

## Objective

To demonstrate how static logs from MuleSoft can be used to:
- Calculate average memory usage, standard deviation
- Define low and high thresholds
- Visualize behavior using static line plots

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Excel (for sample data prep)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
